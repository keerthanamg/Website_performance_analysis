# Website performance analysis:
- Website performance analysis is the process of measuring how fast and efficiently your website loads for visitors. It involves a variety of factors that impact user experience, including page load speed, responsiveness, and stability.
- Website Performance Analysis involves evaluating various metrics related to a website’s functionality, user engagement and overall success in achieving business goals. This form of analysis is critical because it directly impacts user experience, conversion rates, and the profitability and reputation of a business.
- So, if you want to learn how to analyze the performance of a website, this repository is for you.

# Here are some of the benefits of conducting a website performance analysis:
- Improved user experience: Faster loading times and a more responsive website lead to happier visitors who are more likely to stay on your site and convert into customers.
- Enhanced SEO: Search engines consider website speed as a ranking factor, so a faster website can lead to higher search rankings.
- Increased conversions: Studies have shown that slow loading times can lead to a significant drop in conversions. By improving your website's performance, you can increase the number of visitors who take the desired action on your site, such as making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter.

# Dataset: 
- Dataset is from 'Statso'.
- Statso is a Data Science Community to Find Case Studies, Datasets and more!

# Getting started:
The dataset we are working on contains the following columns:

- Session primary channel group: The marketing channel (e.g., Direct, Organic Social)
- Date + hour (YYYYMMDDHH): The specific date and hour of the session
- Users: Number of users in a given period
- Sessions: Number of sessions in that period
- Engaged sessions: Number of sessions with significant user engagement
- Average engagement time per session: The average time a user is engaged per session
- Engaged sessions per user: Ratio of engaged sessions to total sessions per user
- Events per session: Average number of events (actions taken) per session
- Engagement rate: The proportion of sessions that were engaged
- Event count: Total number of events during the period

# Step 1: 
- Import required libraries
- And load the dataset.

# Step 2:
- print(data.head()): There are some errors in the first row of the dataset, which usually occurs while collecting the data from websites. The data starts from the second row, let’s prepare it accordingly:
- new_header = data.iloc[0]  # grab the first row for the header
- data = data[1:]  # take the data less the header row
- data.columns = new_header  # set the header row as the df header
- data.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
- print(data.head())

# Step 3:
- Now, let’s convert the date column into an appropriate datetime format and group it for further analysis:
- data['Date + hour (YYYYMMDDHH)'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date + hour (YYYYMMDDHH)'], format='%Y%m%d%H')
- data['Users'] = pd.to_numeric(data['Users'])
- data['Sessions'] = pd.to_numeric(data['Sessions'])
- grouped_data = data.groupby(data['Date + hour (YYYYMMDDHH)']).agg({'Users': 'sum', 'Sessions': 'sum'})  # group data by date and sum up the users and sessions

The overall purpose of the above operation is to prepare and summarize the dataset for time series analysis, focusing on how user engagement (through sessions) varies by time. By converting data into appropriate types and grouping it by time, you can more easily perform operations like plotting time series graphs, calculating moving averages, or applying time series forecasting models.

# Step 4:
- Now, let’s analyze the total users and sessions over time.
- Plotting the aggregated users and sessions over time:
- website-performance-1.webp 
- From the graph, we can observe there are some fluctuations in the number of users and sessions, possibly indicating daily cycles or specific high-traffic periods. Both users and sessions appear to follow a similar trend, which is expected as more users generally mean more sessions. Some peaks might correspond to specific marketing activities, promotions, or events.

# Step 5:
Now that we’ve analyzed the session trends, let’s move on to User Engagement Analysis. We will look into metrics like average engagement time per session, engagement rate, and events per session to evaluate how engaged users are when they visit the site:

# Step 6:
